No source codes, only public release. the file is too large for it to be published since it only 
handles 25mb and this file is 500mb
How to install:
Put Rise in appdata/roaming/.minecraft/versions
if it errors use UltimMC.
How to install in MultiMC/UltiMC:
Put jar file in "edit instance" then add in version.
if it requests for login, just press login without username it'll work fine

If you get banned with Rise you should use Cape Client (on my profile 😏)
